# Wine_ML

Implemented classification and regression algorithms on the Wine Quality [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
There are two datasets for red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. In this exercise, I implemented the algorithms _only_ on the Red Wine samples. 

There are a total of 12 features including Quality which is a score ranging from 1-10 of the wines. The models presented here tries to first classify the wines based on their quality (criteria is given in the notebook) as Poor, Average and Good. Then regression is applied to predict the Quality.
